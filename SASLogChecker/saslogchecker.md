## `%interact_logchk()` macro <a name="interactlogchk-macros-1"></a> ######

Program Name : interact_logchk.sas (Macro)
 Author       : [Yutaka Morioka]
 Created On   : [2025-07-04]
 Purpose      : Automated SAS log message checker
                 - Intended for interactive execution via a SAS 9.4 GUI custom tool button
                 - Assumes a Windows environment only
                 - Designed to handle mixed encoding environments (SJIS, Unicode, Latin)
                   by matching Japanese messages through HEX string comparisons
                 - Categorizes and displays log messages as ERROR, WARNING, NOTE, or INFO

 Main Features:
   - Always detects all **ERROR** and **WARNING** messages in the SAS log
   - Additionally scans for specific **NOTE** and **INFO** patterns
     These patterns are explicitly chosen by the author based on practical experience
     and do not represent an exhaustive list of all possible SAS notes or info messages.

   [Examples of targeted NOTE / INFO messages:]
     - "Missing values were generated ..."
     - "Variable x is uninitialized"
     - "Division by zero detected ..."
     - "Mathematical operations could not be performed ..."
     - "Invalid argument ..."
     -"Character values have been converted to numeric values"
     -"Numeric values have been converted to character values"
     - "Unreferenced label defined"
     - "WHERE clause has been replaced"
     - "DATA STEP stopped due to looping"
     - "will be overwritten by data set ..."
     - "MERGE statement has more than one data set with repeats of BY values"
     - "Library does not exist"
     - "was not found" (file/format)
     - "reached past the end of a line" (LOST CARD)
     - "Statement not executed due to NOEXEC option"
     - "A CASE expression has no ELSE clause ..."
     - "Some tick values have been thinned"
     - "GROUP BY clause has been discarded because neither SELECT nor HAVING ..."
     - "Processing on disk occurred during summarization"
     - "The log axis cannot support zero or negative values"
     - "lines were truncated"
     - "outside the axis range"
     - "infinite likelihood assumed"
     - "definite matrix is not positive definite"

   - Many of these messages are matched using HEX strings
     to ensure compatibility with multi-byte character encodings (SJIS, Unicode, Latin).

 Limitations:
   - Uses `dm` commands for interactive control, which do not work in Unix or batch mode.
   - The set of HEX patterns may need updates if SAS session encoding differs
     from the original environment where this macro was developed.

## `%logchk2directry()` macro <a name="logchk2directry-macros-2"></a> ######

Macro Name : logcht2directry                                 

Authoer: Yutaka Morioka
License : MIT
                                                             
Overview:                                                    
 Scans all log files (*.log or specified extension) in a     
 given folder, searches for errors, warnings, and specific   
 keywords, and outputs a summary Excel file.                 
                                                             
Character Encoding Support:                                  
 - This macro can handle log files encoded in Shift-JIS      
   or UTF-8.                                                 
 - Japanese keywords are included as hex literals to avoid   
   garbled text and ensure matching regardless of session    
   encoding.                                                 
                                                             
Important Notes:                                             
 - This macro is designed for Windows only.                  
   The file path delimiter "\" and path handling logic        
   (e.g., KSCAN, KREVERSE) assume a Windows environment.     
   It will not work as-is on Unix/Linux/MacOS systems.       
                                                             
Parameters:                                                  
 folder     = Path to the folder containing log files        
 out_folder = Path to the folder for the output Excel file   
 extension  = File extension to search (default: log)        
                                                             
Example Usage:                                               
 %logcht2directry(folder=C:\logs, out_folder=C:\output);
